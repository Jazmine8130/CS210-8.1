# CS210-8.1


- Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This is a banking app to allow users to select an interest rate and determine how much interest they will earn.
Since compounding interest is difficult to calculate this app handles all the math do the user can see the outcomes instead of having to do it themselves. 


- What did you do particularly well?

I really like how the formatting came out and the ease of reading the charts. I did well to format it to make it easy to read. 


- Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

There could be improvements in the final look of the formatting, as well as i feel there were places that i could have shortened or used more 
repetitive code to accomplish the same thing.


- Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

I struggled with getting the math right. I know the math itself was right but how it was calculating everything took longer than i expected to get right. 
There was a time i started writing more specific psudeocode to understand what i wanted the program to do. 


- What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

Learning the correct order to format things in and writing more psudeocode are skills i took away from this project. Understanding how to transfer my thoughts
into the code by writing it out has greatly improved my confidence in coding in general and something i will continue to have and use as long as i code.


- How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

When writing the code, i made sure to include lots of inline comments so someone else would be able to understand why the code is written the way that it is. 
As well, i tried to name the functions and variables so it was obvious what the variable or function was for.
